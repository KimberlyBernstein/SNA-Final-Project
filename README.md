### Final Project

Your final project in LADS-EDU is a chance to pull together the things you have learned this semester about data collection, cleaning, analysis, interpretation, actionability and impact in the context of a specific learning content. Traditionally, this has been an “Analysis” oriented project that involved working in groups to design, conduct and interpret a small analysis designed to produce a particular kind of insight into specific data about learning. In addition, I am offering two other alternatives this year: a “Critique” oriented  project in which you identify an interesting LA tool and then unpack the data and analysis choices inherent in it, observing people in the process of interpretation, critically discussing the possible actions to be taken as a result; and a “Design” oriented  project in which you choose a specific situation and kind of analytic information and create a plan for how that information can be delivered (and to whom), and the ways in which interpretation and action will be supported.

IMPORTANT: 

1.	All project topics and teams **MUST BE APPROVED BY ME** before you start work on them (this is protect you from spending time on something that is unlikely to lead to a successful result / good learning experience.

2.	Teams of 3 people are ideal. Teams of 4 are okay, but you’ll need to coordinate more and make sure everyone contributes. Teams of 2 are fine if you are both heavily invested.

3.	“Critique” and “Design” projects must include detailed consideration of data and analysis choices in addition to the higher-level human / social considerations.

4.	“Analysis” projects must include attention to higher-level human / social considerations as well data and analysis.

5.	Fork and clone the FinalProject.Rmd file which will serve as the template for your report. As a team you will need to decide how to work on the file to deal with version control issues. One option is for one point person to fork the repository to their personal account and then have other team members fork from there. You can then each work on the files and submit pull requests to the main branch which the point person can accept.

**Analysis Projects**

Your report will include 6 parts:

1. QUESTION & DATA : What (hopefully interesting) question are trying to answer and why? Give a description of the data you chose to analyze. Include anything you know about the source of the data (who generated, in what context, doing what activities) and its structure (what does each column and row represent). Length = 2-3 paragraphs 20%

2. ANALYTIC APPROACH: How you will try to answer this question. Describe what kind of analysis technique (e.g. clustering, prediction, social network analysis, natural language processing) you will use and what outcome measure(s) you expect it to produce that will speak to the question. Provide a justification for **why** you think this is a reasonable approach to take and make sure to mention any options you considered, but discarded, and why. Length = 1-2 paragraphs. 10%

3. PROCESS, RESULTS & INTEPRETATION: Briefly describe the steps in your analysis process and the results they produced including any tables, graphs and models you generate. Include both data cleaning and data analyses steps and highlight key choices you made. Length = 1-2 sentence annotation for each **chunk** of code (you do **not** need to explain every single line of code). Do make sure to interpret the meaning of each piece of output (e.g. table, graph, model). 40%

4. ANSWER: Based on your analysis what is the answer to the question you asked? How confident are you in this answer? What are possible alternative explanations for what you have observed.  Length = 1 paragraph. 10%

5. APPLICATION & IMPLICATIONS: What are the learning implications of what you did? (This could be either the specific answer you got or a way that the analysis process you used might be applied). Who will this information be useful to and how do you expect them to act on it? What ethical questions arise in relation to the project you pursued and its potential real-world application. Length = 1 paragraph. 15%

6. REFLECTION: What challenges did you encounter and how did you resolve them? What kinds of help did you use to get through this assignment? What would you do next if you had more time to keep working on the project? Length = 1 paragraph. 5%

**Critique Projects**

Your report will include 6 parts:

1. TOOL: A description of the learning tool you chose to critique including the context and audience for use and the learning need addressed. Length = 1-2 paragraphs. 10%

2. DATA: A description and critical evaluation of the kinds of data used. Include anything you know about the source of the data (who generated, in what context, doing what activities) and its structure (what are the likely cases and variables captured – you may need to infer these b/c you can’t examine them directly). Discuss whether you think the data include was well chosen and what data not included might be useful. Length = 3-4 paragraphs. 20%

3. ANALYTIC APPROACH: A description and critical evaluation of the kinds of analysis technique (e.g. clustering, prediction, social network analysis, natural language processing) that appear to be used. Explain why you think the approach taken was well chosen or not and what other viable possibilities would be (and how they would differ). 2-3 paragraphs. 10%

4. PRESENTATION & INTEPRETATION: A description and critical evaluation of the way the analytic information is presented, can be manipulated by users, and any supports for the process of interpretation that are provided. As part of this, you should conduct a small number of observations (2-4) of members of the target audience actually using the tool. Going beyond simple user testing, you should try to understand how people are relating to and making sense of the information provided. Describe how you conducted the tests and what you learned from them. Length 5-6 paragraph. 40%

5. APPLICATION & IMPLICATIONS: A description and critical evaluation of potential actions users might take as a result of using the analytics. Be specific (perhaps using vignettes) to describe what kinds of information might lead to what kind of action. What ethical questions arise in relation to use of this tool? Length 3-4 paragraph. 15%

6. REFLECTION: What challenges did you encounter and how did you resolve them? What kinds of help did you use to get through this assignment? What would you do next if you had more time to keep working on the project? Length = 1 paragraph. 5%
 “Design” oriented  project in which you choose a specific situation and kind of analytic information and create a plan for how that information can be delivered (and to whom), and the ways in which interpretation and action will be supported.

**Design Projects**

Your report will include 6 parts:

1. LEARNING SITUATION: What learning situation and need will you be designing for? Who will be the audience for your analytic tool and who do you expect to benefit from this use? Length = 1-2 paragraphs 10%.

2. ANALYTIC INFORMATION: A description of the kinds of data / information you will provide to your audience. Explain in as much detail as possible the source of the data you would want to use (who generated, in what context, doing what activities) and the structure you would want it in (what are the likely cases and variables captured – you may need to infer these b/c you can’t examine them directly). Make sure to justify why this is an important and useful data source to address the learning need, and make clear any choices you make about data NOT to include. Length = 3-4 paragraphs. 20%

3. ANALYTIC APPROACH: A description of the kinds of analysis technique (e.g. clustering, prediction, social network analysis, natural language processing) that you would use on the data to produce insight that speaks to the learning need use and what outcome measure(s) you expect it to produce to do so. Provide a justification for **why** you think this is a reasonable approach to take and make sure to mention any options you considered, but discarded, and why. Length = 3-4 paragraphs. 20%

4. PRESENTATION & INTEPRETATION: A description of the way the analytic information would be presented, can be manipulated by users, and any supports for the process of interpretation that are provided. Think carefully about how people will get oriented to the tool and want to work with it in the context you set forth in Part 1. Length = 5-6 paragraph plus minimum 4 visuals. 40%

5. APPLICATION & IMPLICATIONS: A description and of potential actions users might take as a result of using the analytics. Be specific (perhaps using vignettes) to describe what kinds of information might lead to what kind of action. What ethical questions arise in relation to use of this imagined tool? Length 3-4 paragraph. 15%

6. REFLECTION: What challenges did you encounter and how did you resolve them? What kinds of help did you use to get through this assignment? What would you do next if you had more time to keep working on the project? Length = 1 paragraph. 5%

B- | *Borderline.*	Work shows uneven application of course concepts with core elements missing, weakly applied or used inappropriately. Marginal accomplishment of course objectives. 
C+ to D| *Deficient.* Work is inadequate. It is poorly developed or flawed by multiple missing, weak or inappropriately applied elements. Minimal accomplishment of course objectives.  
F | *Fail.*	Work fails to meet minimal expectations for course credit for graduate work.  Accomplishment is consistently weak, with serious limitations in many areas. 

**Important Grading Note**: While you will recieve a group grade on this project, I will also ask each one of you to confidentially share will me each team members contributions to the group as listed below. I will use these assessment collectively to convert the group grade on the project into individual grades.

* Met expectations (they did the work to earn the equivilent of the group grade)

* Exceeded expectations (they went above and beyond and should get a grade a bit higher than the group grade )

* Fell short of expectations (they did not contribute their share and should get a grade a bit lower than the group grade)
